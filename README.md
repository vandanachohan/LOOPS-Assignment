Loops allow you to repeat a section of code multiple times, making it easier to perform tasks that require repetition. There are different types of loops, such as:

- For loops
- While loops
- Do-while loops
- Foreach loops (in some languages)

Each type of loop has its own unique characteristics and use cases. Mastering loops will help you write more efficient, effective, and scalable code.
